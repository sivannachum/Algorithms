DGraphEdgeList and DGraphAdjMatrix directed weighted graph representations. 
The DGraphEdgeList can be initialized by reading a graph from a file and can be converted to a DGraphAdjMatrix. 
The DGraphAdjMatrix has functionality to figure out the all pairs shortest paths lengths using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
There is also a class called FloydWarshallMain in the Demos folder which can be run to interact with the graph classes.
It requires the name of a file from which to read a graph 
and a folder path to which to write the shortest paths lengths information.
