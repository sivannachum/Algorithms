Src folder:
DGraphEdgeList and DGraphAdjList directed graph representations. 
The DGraphEdgeList can be initialized by reading a graph from a file and can be converted to a DGraphAdjList. 
The DGraphAdjList has functionality to figure out the strongly connected components of the graph.
There is also a class called MidtermMain which can be run to interact with the graph classes.
It will ask for a file from which to read a graph and later a file to which to write the strongly connected components.

GraphFiles folder:
Various sample graph files with which the DGraphEdgeList can be initialized.
