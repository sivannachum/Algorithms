Graphs folder:
Three representations of undirected graphs along with main classes for each, 
and a class to represent Edges for the EdgeList graph representation.
There is functionality for multi-edges in the EdgeList and AdjList representations but not in the AdjMatrix representation.

Src folder:
Two representations of GraphAdjList, different from the one in the Graphs folder, along with main classes for each.
One implements a GraphAdjList using a LinkedList internally.
The other allows for DFS to run.
