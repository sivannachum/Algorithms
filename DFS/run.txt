// Since I have submitted the Graphs several times now, they are in a separate folder called Graphs.
// You can compile them by:
javac -d GraphClasses/ Graphs/*.java

// TESTS, APPS and DEMOS
// Individual tests for each class
java -cp GraphClasses GraphEdgeListMain
java -cp GraphClasses GraphAdjListMain
java -cp GraphClasses GraphAdjMatrixMain


// As for the DFS part of the homework, those are in the Src folder.
// Note that the GraphAdjList and the GraphAdjListMain here are different than the ones in the Graphs folder
// as the graph uses a LinkedList in its internal implementation and also contains functionality for DFS
// You can compile them by:
javac -d Classes/ Src/*.java

// TESTS, APPS and DEMOS
// Individual tests for each class
java -cp Classes GraphAdjListMain
java -cp Classes GraphDFSAdjListMain
