Two representations of GraphAdjList, different from the ones in the Graphs folder, along with main classes for each.
Here GraphDFSAdjList is NOT its own runnable class (unlike in the Graphs folder).
The GraphAdjList has methods isConnected and connectedComponents.

Two representations of DGraphAdjList, different from the ones in the DGraphs folder.
These run DFS using colored vertices, keep track of colored edges, and can construct the DFS tree.
