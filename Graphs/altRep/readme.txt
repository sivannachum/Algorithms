This is an alternative representation of the AdjListGraph. It uses an array of LinkedList instead of a ArrayList of ArrayList for the adjacency lists.
It is different from the representation in the DFS folder because it has a constructor for initializing a graph with no vertices or edges
and it has (untested) convertors to the other two graph classes.
Though in this "altrep folder", I use this representation of the adjacency list graph throughout the rest of the code in this repository.
