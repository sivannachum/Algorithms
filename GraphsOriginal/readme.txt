Original graph implementations:
The AdjListGraph uses an ArrayList or ArrayList internally, and users interact with the graph using 0-indexing.

The graphs in the Graphs folder are those used in all code outside of this folder.
The AdjListGraph there uses an array of LinkedList internally, and users interact with the graph using 1-indexing.
